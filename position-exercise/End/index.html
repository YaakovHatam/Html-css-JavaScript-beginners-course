        <p> When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have
            connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which
            the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that
            they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation. </p>
        <p> We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with
            certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness, -- That to secure
            these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,
            -- That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter
            or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its
            powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed,
            will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly
            all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right
            themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations,
            pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right,
            it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. -- Such
            has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter
            their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain [George III] is a history
            of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over
            these States. </p>
