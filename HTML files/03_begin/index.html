        <h1>Jerusalem</h1>
        <p>
            A city called Rušalim in the Execration texts of the Middle Kingdom of Egypt (c. 19th century BCE) is widely, but not universally, identified as Jerusalem.[28][29] Jerusalem is called Urušalim in the Amarna letters of Abdi-Heba (1330s BCE).[30]
            The name "Jerusalem" is variously etymologized to mean "foundation (Sumerian yeru, 'settlement'/Semitic yry' 'to found, to lay a cornerstone') of the god Shalem",[31][32] the god Shalem was thus the original tutelary deity of the Bronze Age city.[33]
            The form Yerushalem or Yerushalayim (Jerusalem) first appears in the Bible, in the Book of Joshua. According to a Midrash, the name is a combination of Yhwh Yir'eh ("God will see to it", the name given by Abraham to the place where he began to sacrifice his son) and the town "Shalem".[34]
