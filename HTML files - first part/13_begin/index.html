        <h1>Jerusalem etymology</h1>
    <p>
        A city called Rušalim in the Execration texts of the Middle Kingdom of Egypt (c. 19th century BCE) is widely, but not universally,
        identified as Jerusalem. Jerusalem is called Urušalim in the Amarna letters of Abdi-Heba (1330s BCE). The name "Jerusalem"
        is variously etymologized to mean "foundation (Sumerian yeru, 'settlement'/Semitic yry' 'to found, to lay a cornerstone')
        of the god Shalem", the god Shalem was thus the original tutelary deity of the Bronze Age city. The form Yerushalem
        or Yerushalayim (Jerusalem) first appears in the Bible, in the Book of Joshua. According to a Midrash, the name is
        a combination of Yhwh Yir'eh ("God will see to it", the name given by Abraham to the place where he began to sacrifice
        his son) and the town &ldquo;Shalem&rdquo;.
